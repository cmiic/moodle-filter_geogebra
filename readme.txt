The geogebra filter makes it easier to embed GeoGebra tools in Moodle Web pages.

GeoGebra is an open source dynamic mathematics application created by Markus Hohenwarter. See www.geogebra.org.The GeoGebra filter allows users to easily include useable GeoGebra files in Moodle Web pages, blog entries, quizzes, and discussion forum posts. It is a revision by S. Arjona Téllez and F. Sonner of the original filter files by Jochen Maeusle (see: http://moodle.org/mod/data/view.php?d=13&rid=585&filter=1).Copyright (C) 2009 Sara Arjona, Florian SonnerThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

How it works:
During installation of the filter the file geogebra.jar will be placed in the Moodle central folder and registered at the moddle system.
Teachers will be able to embed previously uploaded *.ggb (Geogebra) files into a moodle online document simply by creating a link to the ggb file using (as usual) the link symbol in the editor bar (or using the HTML tag <a href="...">). 

As an option you will be able to customize width and height of the applet by adding text to the URL. When saving the document, the link will be automatically converted in HTML-Code, which will display the applet instead of the link.    

Installation: (by Moodle Administrator)

1. Upload the complete folder "geogebra" into the filter folder, such as moodle19>filter
2. In Moodle, navigate to Moodle>Site Administration>Modules>Filters>Manage Filters and click on the entry "Geogebra" to enable the filter.
3. Click on "Settings" to change the version of GeoGebra and .jar file URL (location), the default width and height, and applet parameters. These settings affect all GeoGebra files that use the filter; it is not currently possible to customize the .jar file URL or parameters.

Usage:
A. Displaying GeoGebra Applets 

1. In Moodle, open the Web page, Forum, Blog, or Quiz item in which you want to include the GeoGebra tool.* If you are starting a new web page, go to: Add a resource…> compose a web page. 2. Complete the information. In the body of the content (for a web page, in the “Compose a web page” section), type and then highlight text you will use as a link to the GeoGebra file. This text can be as short as one character, and does not need to be the name of the file itself.3. Click on the link icon (chain).4. Select the GeoGebra file (ending in .ggb). You may need to choose a subfolder, if necessary; if you did not previously upload a file, you can use the button at the bottom to browse to a file, upload it, and then select it.5. Type a Title and click OK.6. When you are done creating your page or activity, save your work using a button at the bottom.7. View your page and check the GeoGebra applet size and functionality. You will see the applet displayed and functional when you view the page, and you will see the text you typed in (to link to the tool) if you edit the page. Verify that the size of the GeoGebra tool is appropriate. If you need to adjust the size, see instructions below. B. Custom GeoGebra Applet Size on an Individual Page
If you want to change the size of the GeoGebra tool(s) in a specific Moodle page, Forum post, Blog, or Quiz item, you can specify the size by adding text after the file URL. If you want to change the default size, go to the filter Settings page (see the installation instructions).1. Add or edit the page, post, or item that includes the GeoGebra tool link text.2. Type and then highlight text you will use as a link to the GeoGebra file. This text can be as short as one character, and does not need to be the name of the file itself. 3. Click on the link icon (chain).4. Select the GeoGebra file (ending in .ggb). You may need to choose a subfolder, if necessary; if you did not previously upload a file, you can use the button at the bottom to browse to a file, upload it, and then select it.5. In the URL field itself (do NOT click OK to return to editing), add the characters to define the custom width and/or height, following this format:/myFileName.ggb?w=#&h=#    (# are number of pixels [px])For example:/myFileName.ggb?w=200	(width is 200px, height is the default value)/myFileName.ggb?h=500	(width is the default value, height is 500px)/myFileName.ggb?w=200&h=500	(both width and height are custom values, in this example, width is 200 px and height is 500 px)6. Type a Title and click OK.7. When you are done creating your page or activity, save your work using a button at the bottom.8. View your page and check the GeoGebra applet size and functionality. If you include more than one GeoGebra tool in a single page, you can have different sizes for each tool.*NOTES (as of this writing):Blogs.You can embed GeoGebera files in blog entires and use custom sizes. If you attach a GeoGebra file (.ggb) to a blog entry, the filter will cause the attached file to display using the default width and height. Users can still download the file by clicking on the file icon.Forums.The method described above should work in a forum post, and the filter should also display the file if you attach it. You can both attach and link in the same post. Attached files display using the default width and height.Quizzes.The filter should work properly when you link GeoGebra files (.ggb) in some types of items, such as a Description. Also, since some quiz fields (such as mutliple choice response fields) allow the use of html code but do not have a WYSIWYG editor, it is possible to insert a GeoGebra tool using html code. You can copy this from a WYSISYG editor in Moodle using the Toggle HTML Source button (< >) to see the code; make sure to upload the .ggb file and include this location in the html code.An example line of code (using custom width=400px and height=200 px) is:<a href="http://www.myWebSite.org/…/myFileName.ggb?w=400&h=200" title="titleText">toolName</a>
